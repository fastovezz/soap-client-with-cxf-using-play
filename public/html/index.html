    <p>Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption is a 2000 role-playing video game developed by Nihilistic Software. Released
        by Activision for Microsoft Windows on June 7, 2000, and for Mac OS in 2001, the game is based on White Wolf
        Publishing's role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade. It follows the vampire Christof Romuald from the Dark
        Ages of 12th century Prague and Vienna to modern-day London and New York City in search of his humanity and his
        kidnapped love, the nun Anezka. The player controls Christof and up to three allies in first- and third-person
        perspectives. Nihilistic took 24 months to complete the game on a budget of US$1.8 million. The game received a
        mixed critical response; reviewers praised its graphics and multiplayer functionality, but were polarized by the
        quality of the story and combat. Its high-quality graphics and sound ran poorly on some computer systems. It
        received the 1999 Game Critics Awards for Best Role-Playing Game. Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines, set in
        the same fictional universe, was released in November 2004. </p>
